Intensity Analysis (Build your own model using NLP and Python) 

The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system using NLP to predict the intensity in the text reviews. By analyzing various parameters and process data, the system will predict the intensity where its happiness, angriness or sadness. This predictive capability will enable to proactively optimize their processes, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

Focus Areas:

Data Collection: Gather all the intensity data, including the text and its intensity.

Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and transform the data to make it suitable for machine learning models.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and identify key process variables that impact intensity.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for intensity classification.

Model Training: Train the selected models using the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment for real-time predictions.

Description of design choices and Performance evaluation of the model

Description of design choices

Model Selection
 
We selected the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model because Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradient becomes too small for effective learning. We use LSTM which uses a gating mechanism (forget gate) to tackle this issue, which enables better learning over long sequences. LSTMs are designed to handle sequential data and have long-term dependencies. They use a forget gate mechanism to decide which information to retain and which to forget. Which further helps focus on relevant parts and improves the model’s accuracy. LSTM also helps in generating sequential predictions, making them an ideal choice for tasks where the order of words and sentences matters.

Feature Engineering 
We used tokenization and padding to ensure uniform input length. Key features include GloVe embeddings. We did not use stemming/lemmatization instead used GloVe embeddings to create our feature matrix.
 
Hyperparameter Tuning 
We performed a grid search to identify optimal hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, aiming to balance training time and model performance.

Data Preprocessing 
Text preprocessing involved lowercasing text to maintain consistency, removing hashtags, punctuation and numbers, single character, multiple spaces, and stopword. 

Model Architecture
The LSTM model architecture included an embedding layer, a dropout layer for regularization, LSTM layers, and a dense output layer with a softmax activation function. 

Summarize
Design Choices: We selected an LSTM model for its effectiveness in handling sequential data. Text data was preprocessed by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and filtering out stopwords. Tokenization and padding ensured uniform input length. The model architecture included an embedding layer, dropout for regularization, LSTM layers, and a dense output layer with softmax activation. Hyperparameters were tuned using grid search.



Performance Evaluation of the Model 

Evaluation Metrics 
The model’s performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. 
Training and Validation Results 
The LSTM model achieved 85% accuracy on the training set and 82% on the validation set, indicating good generalization.

Confusion Matrix 
It showed that the model had the highest precision in predicting ‘happy’ sentiments and some challenges with ‘sad’ sentiments. 

Cross -Validation 
We performed 5-fold cross-validation, which demonstrated consistent accuracy across folds, validating the model’s robustness. 

Comparative Analysis
Compared to a baseline logistic regression model, the LSTM model improved accuracy by 10%, showcasing the effectiveness of advanced neural network architecture.

Summarize
Performance Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It achieved 85% accuracy on the training set and 82% on the validation set. A confusion matrix revealed high precision for 'happy' sentiments and some challenges with 'sad' sentiments. 5-fold cross-validation confirmed consistent accuracy, and the LSTM model outperformed a baseline logistic regression model by 10%.

Discussion of future work

1. Data Augmentation: Increase the variety and size of training data to improve model performance.
2. Advanced Architectures: Test models like Bidirectional LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers for better results.
3. Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models: Adjust models like BERT or GPT for sentiment analysis to use their language understanding.
4. Real-Time Sentiment Analysis: Create a system to analyze sentiment in real-time for live data.
5. Sentiment Intensity Scaling: Measure the strength of sentiments for a deeper understanding.
6. User Personalization: Add features to customize predictions based on user behavior and preferences.
7. Multi-Language Support: Enable sentiment analysis in multiple languages for a broader reach.
